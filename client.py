Client Module

This module defines a simple client application that connects to a server, sends requests, and receives responses.

The client can send two types of requests ('requetetype1' or 'requetetype2') and communicate with a secondary server
on a dynamically assigned port. It allows the user to send multiple requests and terminates based on user input.
